## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The following was new to me and I got to know about it when I got stuck on how to fit the image in the specified grid I allocated for it

```css
.product-img img { 
  object-fit: fill;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
